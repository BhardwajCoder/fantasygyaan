   <p>If you  want to know <strong>ipl is fixed or not</strong> so you are at the right place so answer is <strong>NO ipl is not fixed</strong> because Ipl is hosted by BCCI. BCCI is the cricket board of india and BCCI do not support any type of fixing in cricket so Bcci strictly watch the players and their staff so there is no chance of fixing and scripted matches but many times we saw the things there are some people and teams were involved in fixing and you see Bcci banned these players and teams for sometime like sometime  before you saw chennai and rajasthan  banned for 2 years from IPL.but after this incident Bcci taken some strict actions against the players and teams who involved in fixing things. so there is a very rare chance of fixing matches in the ipl.so at this time there is no chance of fixing matches or scripted  matches in ipl. </p>
