   <p>But when we look to the question can cricket overtake football so <strong>I thik chances is very less</strong> because when we look to the both sports that football is more popular right now and cricket is growing still and the other factor is  <strong>for playing football No equipment needed you just need one ball and an empty ground</strong> but on the other hand <strong>for playing cricket you need equipments bat,ball and when you play with season ball you need season kit</strong>so football need less equipments and football is very famous in Europe and African countries or world wide but cricket is still growing and famous in India,Pakistan,Australia and England like countries or famous in countable countries so the chances of overtaking cricket is very less  </p>
